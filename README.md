 Hi, I am Arpan,
I've been programming in the framework called phaser2 and I am stuck with my code. If anyone could help me solve this I would really
appreciate it. 

Actually, I've made a game in phaser2 and its almost done. but, the problem is I can't get to kill child sprites in it. I created
child sprites, but when I try to kill the main sprite, it kills all the children linked to it as all are associated with the same variable... Is there any way I can kill the child sprite ONLY the onle I am interacting using collider with it? please help.

Thank you
